# Apache Spark for Beginner 
--- 


Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system that provides a fast and general-purpose cluster-computing framework. Initially developed at the University of California, Berkeley's AMPLab, the Spark codebase was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation, which has maintained it since. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.
